## Best Practices for PhD Manuscript Writing

### General Writing Principles

1. **Write Every Day**
   - Set a daily writing goal (e.g., 500 words or 2 hours)
   - Write even when you don't feel inspired
   - Editing comes later; focus on getting words down first

2. **Start with the Easy Parts**
   - You don't have to write in order
   - Start with methodology (often easiest since you know what you did)
   - Introduction and conclusion often come last

3. **Use the "Shitty First Draft" Approach**
   - Don't aim for perfection on the first pass
   - Just get your ideas down
   - Revise and polish later

4. **Get Feedback Early and Often**
   - Share drafts with your supervisor regularly
   - Don't wait until everything is "perfect"
   - Incorporate feedback as you go

5. **Maintain Consistent Style**
   - Use the same tense within sections (usually past for methods/results, present for discussion)
   - Be consistent with terminology
   - Follow your field's conventions

### Organization & Time Management

1. **Break Large Tasks into Small Ones**
   - Instead of "write literature review," break it into:
     - Find 10 key papers on topic X
     - Summarize each paper in 1 paragraph
     - Group papers by theme
     - Write synthesis of theme 1
     - etc.

2. **Use the Pomodoro Technique**
   - Work in focused 25-minute blocks
   - Take 5-minute breaks
   - After 4 blocks, take a longer 15-30 minute break

3. **Set Weekly Goals**
   - Every Monday, set specific, achievable goals for the week
   - Every Friday, review what you accomplished
   - Adjust next week's goals accordingly

4. **Track Your Progress**
   - Update the progress tracker above weekly
   - Celebrate small wins
   - Don't get discouraged by slow progress; writing takes time

### Structure & Content

1. **Each Chapter Should Tell a Story**
   - Clear beginning (what this chapter covers)
   - Middle (the main content)
   - End (summary and transition to next chapter)

2. **Use Signposting**
   - Tell readers what's coming: "This chapter is organized as follows..."
   - Tell readers where they've been: "As discussed in Section 2.3..."
   - Use clear transitions between sections

3. **Every Paragraph Should Have One Main Point**
   - Start with a topic sentence
   - Support it with evidence/explanation
   - Conclude or transition to next point

4. **Use Active Voice When Possible**
   - "We conducted experiments" > "Experiments were conducted"
   - More engaging and easier to read
   - Check your field's conventions (some prefer passive in methods)

5. **Define Terms and Acronyms**
   - Define specialized terms on first use
   - Spell out acronyms on first use
   - Don't assume readers know your jargon

### Figures & Tables

1. **Make Figures Self-Explanatory**
   - Include clear labels and legends
   - Write detailed captions
   - Reader should understand the figure without reading the text

2. **Refer to Every Figure and Table**
   - Always reference figures/tables in the text
   - Explain what the reader should notice
   - Don't just say "see Figure 1"—tell them what to see

3. **Use High-Quality Graphics**
   - Vector graphics (PDF, SVG) for diagrams and plots
   - High-resolution images (300 dpi minimum)
   - Consistent style across all figures

### Citations & References

1. **Cite as You Write**
   - Add citations immediately when you make a claim
   - Don't leave placeholders like [citation needed]
   - Keep your bibliography file organized

2. **Use a Reference Manager**
   - Consider Zotero, Mendeley, or JabRef
   - Can generate BibTeX entries automatically
   - Helps organize PDFs and notes

3. **Check Citations Carefully**
   - Verify all citation details are correct
   - Ensure page numbers are included where required
   - Follow your field's citation style consistently

### Revision Strategy

1. **Revise in Layers**
   - **First pass:** Structure and argument flow
   - **Second pass:** Paragraph and sentence clarity
   - **Third pass:** Grammar, spelling, formatting
   - Don't try to fix everything at once

2. **Read Your Work Aloud**
   - Helps catch awkward phrasing
   - Identifies run-on sentences
   - Ensures natural flow

3. **Get Distance Before Revising**
   - Write a section, then let it sit for a few days
   - Come back with fresh eyes
   - Easier to spot problems

4. **Use a Checklist**
   - See "Final Checks Before Submission" below
   - Review systematically
   - Don't rely on memory

### Dealing with Writer's Block

1. **Just Write Anything**
   - Write bullet points
   - Write a bad version
   - Write what you plan to write about
   - You can always revise later

2. **Change Your Environment**
   - Work from a different location
   - Try writing by hand
   - Use a different computer/app

3. **Work on a Different Section**
   - Stuck on intro? Work on methods
   - Can't face writing? Work on figures
   - Make progress somewhere

4. **Talk It Out**
   - Explain your ideas to a colleague
   - Record yourself and transcribe
   - Sometimes speaking is easier than writing

## Motivational Reminders

- **Done is better than perfect.** Ship your thesis, don't perfect it forever.
- **Every word counts.** Even 100 words a day = 36,500 words a year.
- **You know more than you think.** You're the expert on your research.
- **Writer's block is normal.** Take breaks, change tasks, come back refreshed.
- **Your thesis doesn't have to be groundbreaking.** It has to be done.
- **Progress, not perfection.** Small steps forward every day.
